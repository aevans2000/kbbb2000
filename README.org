* TODO Experiment 1

- Data for this experiment is in the process of being cleaned / uploaded

* Experiment 2

Experiment 2 replicated Experiment 1, except that we manipulated subjects' beliefs about the source of the privileged objects.  This independent variable, =psource= had two levels: =EX= and =RN=, corresponding to whether participants were led to believe that experimenter chose the privileged objects (=EX=) or that the privileged objects were chosen randomly, by lottery (=RN=).  This experiment is described on pages 35--37 of the paper.

There are two data files in the =exp2= directory, with the following variables.

** =exp2_subjects.csv=

| =subj=  | unique integer identifying each subject |
| =psource= | condition subject was in (=EN=, =RN=)   |

** =exp2_trials.csv=

| =subj=     | unique integer identifying each subject                                       |
| =object=   | experimental stimulus identifier                                              |
| =cond=     | whether critical hidden object was competitor (=E=) or noncompetitor (=C=)    |
| =firstfix= | first fixation on the target (in milliseconds)                                |
| =rt=       | final fixation on the target (in milliseconds)                                |
| =regrab=   | reaches/grabs of critical hidden object (=R= = reach, =G= = grab, =-= = none) |
| =nfix=     | number of fixations on the critical hidden object                             |
| =totfix=   | total fixation time on critical hidden object (in milliseconds)               |
